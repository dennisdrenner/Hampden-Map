# Neighborhood Map Project for Udacity Nanodegree



## Purpose

This project was a requirement for my Udacity.com Front-End Development Nanodegree and now serves as a portfolio piece. It allowed me to practice such skills as Ajax, using third party web APIS (Google Maps and Yelp), using Oauth authentication, and using Javascript libraries (Knockout.js, jQuery and jQuery UI are used in this project). 

## How to use

To start, simply download the full repository and then drag index.html into your favorite browser. Alternatively, 
open up http://dennisdrenner.github.io/Hampden-Map/. 

Application initializes showing all locations on the map and in the listview. Locations can be further
filtered by choosing a category or categories (bar, shop, restaurant), or by typing in some search text to match the location name. 

These searches work at the same time, so if you type "Charm" into the searchbox, you will see "Charm City Headshots" (a photographer) and "The Charmery" (an ice cream shop).  If you then choose the photographer category, you will only see "Charm City Headshots."

Clicking any pin on the map will call up information from the Yelp API and display that in the box below the listview.
